<p>Run +phpunit or +behat to run the tool tests or behavior tests.</p>
<p>The scripts will automatically pull in any dependencies. You may adjust which
tools/versions are pulled in via the composer.json file. If the system detects
you din&#39;t perform an install it will perform one for you; you may need to
re-run the tool after the install is done.</p>
<p>Use +cleanup if you need to remove all the tooling for the purpose of
performing some theme-check via a 3rd party plugin. There&#39;s no need to worry
about download times, the composer dependencies, which are the bulk of the
testing toolset will automatically be cached so you will only need to
re-download if you&#39;re retrieving an updated version.</p>
